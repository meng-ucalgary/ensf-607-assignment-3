## Due Dates

Submission before 11:59 PM on Friday, October 8

## Objectives

In Lab Assignment 1 you were tasked by creating a student registration system based on the UML diagram given to you in the lecture material. In this assignment, you will modify the design of your application to MVC. Your final submission should have the same functionality of the application you developed in lab 1. However, for this assignment you must have a GUI instead of a console-based application.

The deliverables for this assignment include:

- Modified UML diagram(s) to show case your design. You may choose to have more than one UML diagram to show a meaningful high-level and low-level view of the system. UML package diagram and class diagram are appropriate to use.

- Your Java application which must be delivered in 3 packages:
   - Model
   - View
